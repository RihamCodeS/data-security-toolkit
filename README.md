# Data Security Toolkit

A collection of Python scripts for secure data management and validation, including encryption, integrity verification, role-based access control, and a fact-checking simulation. Designed for developers seeking reliable solutions for modern data security challenges.

## Overview

Each module in this repository is self-contained and serves a specific purpose in ensuring data reliability and security.

### Modules

1. **Data Encription and Security** (`data-encryption-and-security/data_encryption_and_security.py`)  
   - Provides functions for encrypting, decrypting, and validating data using the Fernet encryption mechanism.  
   - Ensures secure handling of sensitive information.

2. **Data Integrity Verification** (`data-integrity-verification/data_integrity_verification.py`)  
   - Implements hash-based data verification using SHA-256.  
   - Ensures data integrity by verifying that data remains unaltered.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** (`role-based-access-control/role_based_access_control.py`)  
   - Demonstrates role-based user permissions for secure access to resources.  
   - Includes decorators for enforcing access rules.

4. **Fact-Check Simulator** (`fact-verification-simulator/fact_verification_simulator.py`)  
   - Simulates a fact-checking process with random results as a placeholder.  
   - Can be integrated with real APIs for more robust functionality.
